# Predicting-Car-Prices
I want to predict the car prices from dataset https://www.dcc.fc.up.pt/~ltorgo/Regression/DataSets.html

and will explore several methods to do so.


The .txt file containing the data set is first load into a pandas data-frame.


I then use the ISTA algorithm to predict the prices by regularized regression.
